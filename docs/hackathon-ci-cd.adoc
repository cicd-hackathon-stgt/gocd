Pipeline as a first class citizen

Pipeline contains Stages
Stage is a group of Operations. Can be run in parallel.
Tasks - a task is one command line. i.e. install, build, 


== Goals for Today

* Setup GoCD
* myfirst pipeline as gui
* myfirst pipeline as code
* serialized build
* cached dependencies
* scaling
* value map presentation
* fan in, fan out, deploy on aws

== GoCD Architecture

* One Server
* Multiple Agents
* An Agent is running a Stage


== Setup GoCD

=== On AWS

There is already a ready to run AMI at AWS.


=== On my Mac with Docker

I want to setup GoCD on my Macintosh with an Agent with which i can build a small Spring Boot application.
I need a java compiler and maven on the Agent.


Welcome to the world of pain!

First we start an actual GoCD Server. 

NOTE: Why the heck is there no docker image tagged with *latest*?
....
docker run -d -p8153:8153 -p8154:8154 gocd/gocd-server:v18.2.0
....

Now i went through some pain trying to build my own docker imnage with an agent based on an official gocd/go-agent image.
Unfortunately the gocd-agents do NOT contain a full JDK, but only a JRE.
Luckily there is a bit heavy but working agent thanks to Ashwanth Kumar!
The git repo for that agent is https://github.com/ashwanthkumar/docker-gocd-agent-jdk-aws-maven-sbt[here].

....
docker run -d --net="host" -e GO_SERVER_URL=https://localhost:8154/go ashwanthkumar/gocd-agent-jdk-aws-maven-sbt:latest
....

After starting the agent you have to go to the GoCD Server frontend to the Agents section and *activate* the agent.

Now lets setup a simple pipeline!

== My first pipeline

My project is located https://github.com/herrwieger/springbootsample[here]

I setup a simple pipeline in GoCD with the web frontend.

In the second step, the connection to source code repo got configured.
They use the rather strange sounding name material for dealing with that.

Now its time to setup the first build step.
Out of the box GoCD does not support Maven that much.
Supported tools are: Ant, Nant, Rake.
If you do not use one of these tools you can invoke an arbitrary command line.
The only prerequsite is, that the build agent runninbg this task needs the respective tool locally installed.

Support for mvn is rather linmited. But at least you can lookup typical mvn invocations.

Finishing the three step wizard you get a simple pipeline, which can compile a mvn project.

Going back on the pipeline tab in the web frontend you get an overview over all available pipelines.

Now you can start the pipeline by pressing the pause symbol (to unpause) and then the start button.

Clicking on the pipeline name shows you the execution history of the pipeline.

Getting info on an execution run you have to go over the build status bar on the info icon and click.

So now you get the stage details.

And from here you can get the info on the jobs executed.

Clicking on the job name finally moves you to the console output of the job.
